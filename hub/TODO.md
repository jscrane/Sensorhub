- maybe run lcd client in a loop?
- aggregate wired sensor data (at sensorhub instead of the database?)
- split out mysql storage into new mux client process
- add status mux client (for status LEDs on rpi)
- add mux client for mqtt (https://opensensors.io/)
- merge mux into hub
- library for mux-clients (parsing data, etc.)
